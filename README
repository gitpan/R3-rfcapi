R3::rfcapi - Perl extension for SAP rfcsdk

COPYRIGHT
=========

Copyright (c) 1999, Johan Schoen. All rights reserved.

R3::rfcapi is free software; you may use, modify and redistribute it
under the same terms as Perl itself.

To use the R3::rfcapi you also need the RFCSDK which is proprietary
software owned by SAP AG.

INTRODUCTION
============

R3::rfcapi is not intended to be used directly. Use R3::conn, R3::func and 
R3::itab to get an object oriented interface to SAP R/3 remote function
calls.

The R3::* modules are still under construction; the interface may change
in future versions.

REQUIREMENTS
============

The R3::rfcapi requires Perl 5, a C compiler and SAP's RFCSDK.

The RFCSDK is available on the R/3 Frontend CD and/or via ftp
from any of SAP's sapserv. If you have legal access to an R/3 system
you should be able to obtain it - if not, you should not use the
R3::* modules anyway.

INSTALLATION
============

On Linux and HP-UX (and probably other UNIX like systems):
	$ perl Makefile.PL
	$ make
	$ make test
	$ make install
	$ make -f Makefile.aperl inst_perl
Unfortunatly static linking is needed.
You probably have to be root to run the last two commands.
If you want an other name on the perl executable do:
	$ perl Makefile.PL MAP_TARGET=r3perl
	$ make
	$ make test
	$ make install
	$ make -f Makefile.aperl inst_perl MAP_TARGET=r3perl

On NT with VC++:
	D:\R3>perl Makefile.PL
	D:\R3>nmake
	D:\R3>nmake test
	D:\R3>nmake install

On other platforms:
Sorry, I do not know. Please tell me if you do.
